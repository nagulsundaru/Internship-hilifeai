                (n√©e van Os)an English teacher, and Craig Hemsworth, a
                social-services counsellor. He is the second of three sons, following
                Luke (born 1980) and preceding Liam (born 1990) both of them are also 
                actors. His maternal grandfather is a Dutch immigrant 
                and his maternal grandmother is of Irish descent [non-primary source needed] on his paternal 
                line he is of English, Scottish, and German ancestry. He was brought up both 
                in Melbourne and in the Outback in Bulman, Northern Territory. He has said, 
                "My earliest memories were on the cattle stations up in the Outback,
                and then we moved back to Melbourne and then back out there and then back again. 
                Certainly most of my childhood was in Melbourne but probably my most
                vivid memories were up there [in Bulman] with crocodiles and buffalo. Very different walks of life.
                He attended high school at Heathmont College
                before his family again returned to the Northern Territory, 
                and then moved a 
                few years later to Phillip Island

                Early work (2002 2010)
                Hemsworth started his career by appearing in several television series.
                In 2002, Hemsworth starred in two episodes of fantasy television series 
                Guinevere Jones as King Arthur, 
                as well as making an appearance in soap opera series Neighbours and 
                episode of Marshall Law.  
                The following year, he appeared in an episode of The Saddle Club. 
                In 2004, Hemsworth auditioned for 
                the role of Robbie Hunter in Australian soap opera Home and Away.
                He did not receive the part, but was 
                subsequently recalled for the part of Kim Hyde. He moved to 
                Sydney to join the cast, appearing in 
                episodes of the series. He left the cast of Home and Away
                on 3 July 2007. Hemsworth later remarked
                that although he became more visible after Home and Away,
                his work on a soap opera did not earn him
                respect within the film industry.

                chris Hemsworth was a contestant on the fifth season 
                of Dancing with the Stars Australia, partnered
                with professional dancer Abbey Ross. The season premiered on 
                26 September 2006, and after six weeks, Hemsworth was eliminated on 7 November.
                Hemsworth's appearance in the franchise would almost cost him the role of Thor, 
                as producers of the Marvel film franchise feared fans would be put off.

               In 2009, Hemsworth played James T. Kirk's father, George Kirk,
                in the opening scenes of J. J. Abrams' film Star Trek. The role was initially
                offered to Matt Damon, who turned it down; Abrams appreciated Hemsworth taking on the
                role.Josh Tyler of Cinema Blend was impressed with Hemsworth, describing the actor's
                scene as the "best five minutes I've spent in a movie theater this year.
                The film was a box office success, grossing US$385.7 million.[16] That same year, Hemsworth
                played the character Kale Garrity in the thriller A Perfect Getaway. It was a modest success,
                grossing US$22 million against a US$14 million budget,[17] and received mixed reviews,but 
                was praised for his "appropriately intimidating" performance of a "thuggish backpacker. Paul Young
                of Screen Rant also praised Hemsworth's performance as "solid.

               Hemsworth went on to play Sam in 2010's Ca$h alongside English actor Sean Bean,
                was the first film he shot when he arrived in the United States. The film's director,
               Stephen Milburn Anderson, said Hemsworth had only been in the United States for six 
               weeks when he had auditioned for the role, recalling, "Here's a guy who is young, has the right look,
               is a very good actor and, let's face it, he's beautiful. So I say, we need to get this guy in. I was
               very impressed".[22] In November 2010, The Hollywood Reporter named Hemsworth one of the young male 
               has the right look, is a very good actor and, let's face it, he's beautiful. So I say, we need to 
               get this guy in. I was very impressed".[22] In November 2010, The Hollywood Reporter named Hemsworth
               one of the young male actors who are "pushing 
               or being pushed" onto the Hollywood "A-List"
