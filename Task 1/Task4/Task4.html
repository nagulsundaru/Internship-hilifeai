            <h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>
                Christopher Hemsworth was born on 11 August 1983 in Melbourne to Leonie
                (n√©e van Os)an English teacher, and Craig Hemsworth, a
                social-services counsellor. He is the second of three sons, following
                Luke (born 1980) and preceding Liam (born 1990) both of them are also 
                actors. His maternal grandfather is a Dutch immigrant 
                and his maternal grandmother is of Irish descent [non-primary source needed] on his paternal 
                line he is of English, Scottish, and German ancestry. He was brought up both 
                in Melbourne and in the Outback in Bulman, Northern Territory. He has said, 
                "My earliest memories were on the cattle stations up in the Outback,
                and then we moved back to Melbourne and then back out there and then back again. 
                Certainly most of my childhood was in Melbourne but probably my most
                vivid memories were up there [in Bulman] with crocodiles and buffalo. Very different walks of life.
                He attended high school at Heathmont College
                before his family again returned to the Northern Territory, and then moved a 
                few years later to Phillip Island
