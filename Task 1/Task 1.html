The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. These 
    devices use Apple's iOS mobile operating system. The first-generation <br>
     was announced by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, 
     Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates
    . As of November 1, 2018,
     more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold..</p>

        In the industrial design field of human computer interaction, 
    a user interface (UI) is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur.
     The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human,
      while the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process.
      Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive 
      aspects of computer operating systems,
       hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls,
       and process controls. The design considerations applicable when 
       creating user interfaces are related to,
        or involve such disciplines as, ergonomics and psychology..</p>
<p style="color:rgb(250, 242, 242);">
    Generally, the goal of user interface design is to produce a user interface that makes it easy,
     efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) to operate a machine in the way 
     which produces the desired result (i.e. maximum usability). 
     This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the
      desired output,
     and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the user.
